# Object-Oriented-Eng-Analysis-and-Design

Lab work and term project for Object Oriented Eng Analysis and Design accomplished using Java and Netbeans IDE.

Analysis and design of complex engineering systems, software development, and programming fundamentals. In particular, Understanding Objects in Java, Abstraction and Decomposition, Procedural Abstraction, Data Abstraction, Modeling with UML, Design Patterns, Requirements Elicitation and Analysis, System and Object Design. Testing and Debugging. Creating requirement specifications prior to the design and implementation of such engineering systems.

A software development project was developed to illustrate the design processâ€”development of expertise in analyzing, designing, implementing, and testing industrial-quality, reusable software systems. 

# Project (Bookstore Application) Overview
Bookstore application designed to manage book inventory and customer interactions. It provides two types of users: owner and customer. The owner has privileges to manage customers and books, including adding and deleting them. The customer, after successful registration by the owner, can log in and select books for purchase, with options to pay by redeeming points or cash.

The rationale for using the State Design Pattern is based on the need for the application to handle different states for users (owner and customer) and adapt its behavior accordingly. By employing this pattern, the code becomes more organized, modular, and easier to maintain and extend.

The Bookstore's primary features include user authentication, book selection, payment options, and data management for books and customers. It ensures that changes made by the owner are reflected in the application's data files and that the application handles exceptions and special requirements, such as invalid logins and book availability. Overall, the Bookstore aims to provide a functional and user-friendly bookstore application for both owners and customers.
